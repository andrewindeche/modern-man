<p>The README documents details for the Implementation of a ReactJs and Django Application for a Men's wear website</p>

## <h1> Description</h1>
<p>The Aim of the project is to build a React.js and Python Django web project for an Ecommerce site for a mens' wear with searchable categories of men's attire including: Suits, Shirts, NeckWear & Accessories</p>

## Tool Implementation Choices/Decisions
<p><b>Github</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Github was used as a default repository for storing the codebase.It is popular, allows for collaboration and reviews, it allows for integration of other CI/CD tools and versioning for building of scalable applications</li>
</ul>
<p><b>ReactJs</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project was built using ReactJs Based Javascript FrontEnd Library. Jsx syntax was used for the project. A minimal ReactJs App was used to build the application from scratch for efficiency in space uilization and simplicity in the Application functionality.
</ul>
</ul>

## <h1> Commands for Running the Project</h1>
## Docker Environment
Run `Docker compose build` to build a new image and `Docker compose up`  to open up the virtulized container version of the project. Navigate to  development server at `localhost://0.0.0.0:8000/` to open up the project.

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production server
Run `npm run start` for a production server, after building the project and generating neccesary statis files. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `touch component.jsx` to generate a new component. The pages are located in the pages directory and are useful in routing while the components are located in a components directory for modularity and reusability.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build` directory.

## Run Linter

Run`npm run lint` to execute linting of the Next Js application. The dependency can be configured using `npm install` command.
